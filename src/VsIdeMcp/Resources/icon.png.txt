This is a placeholder for icon.png (128x128)

To create a proper icon:
1. Create a 128x128px PNG image
2. Use your favorite image editor (Paint.NET, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
3. Save it as icon.png in this Resources folder
4. Delete this .txt file

For now, you can use a simple colored square or download an icon from:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://icons8.com/
- Or create one with an online tool

The icon should represent the Visual Studio MCP Server (e.g., VS logo + connection symbol)
